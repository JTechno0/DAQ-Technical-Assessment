# Brainstorming

This file is used to document your thoughts, approaches and research conducted across all tasks in the Technical Assessment.

Reading through each task, I have the least experience with cloud and will basically be going in blind for that so I'll leave it to last if I have time, Firmware is the easiest as I have lots of experience breaking down inputs, telemetry will be second since I know what to do but it will take me a bit to remember all of react.
## Firmware
First I'll examine the output.txt logs, write down how to break them down by hand, then I'll write code to pull each part out, code the any translation layer for easy reading, then format in one string. Then I'll work out how to extract the entire log and save the formatted verison in a new log. 
Then i'll research info for the second question.

So after 4 days or on and off work I've cracked it, I wrote two sets of code, one where I hardcoded lots of the translation and really only broke up the data, I did this because I knew I could so I would get something done and two because I didn't realise lists existed. Arrays and lists are universal but when I looked into arrays lists completly slipped my mind, by not using lists I found it impossible to do what I wanted to. The new code is a bit messy, probably very inefficent, but I am confident it would hold up to new data and new tests. So after a couple of times hitting my head on a wall, I've done it. On to part 2.
## Telemetry
I just need to find the bugs, make colour change and make it look cooler, I can't make it look cooler but I can definity change the colour and find a bug.


## Cloud
