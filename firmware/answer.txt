Question 1:
CAN's biggest advantage is its long transmission distance of 40m and the 
fact it doesn't need a host computer. In CAN every device has a CAN 
controller which lets it send and recieve data, that means devices can 
be connected directly to each other without going through a host or a 
switch. In contrast USB -which is a very popular communication standard- 
has a range of 5 metes and requires a host controller between all devices
connected. In automotive applications long wire runs are to be expected
and redundency is important, most applications need decent speed but not
insane bandwidth. A lot of communication standards are designed for 
short high bandwidth runs, pci, usb, spi etc so when looking for
alternatives the field is narrow espcially in 2024, these communication
standards have been around for ages and so most devices are designed to
deal with them. Another old transfer protocal is ethernet, it has long 
runs and has good redundency but in a car it can be impractical, a 
switch is needed to send data to and from areas, the connector itself is 
bulky and devices in cars aren't designed with a ethernet ports.

Overall CAN is in a very subgroup of long range, accurate, fast data 
transfer that doesn't require a single host. This means compared to other
common solutions it is one of the best for redbacks purpose's.
